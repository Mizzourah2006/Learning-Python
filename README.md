# Introduction to Python

I feel that having at least a basic understanding of the Python language is important before moving into the specific data focused packages like Numpy and Pandas. Below are two courses I found very valuable. 

- [Intro to CS with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)
  - This course is provided by MIT and is fairly difficult, but it provides you with a great intro background to Python and basic concepts in Computer Science.
- [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/). I think I can find a coupon code for this one for $9.99 instead of $19.99 if anyone wants to actually purchase it. 
  - This [link](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=CURRENT_STU_COMPY) should include the coupon.
